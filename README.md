# Full-Stack Bootcamp - Week 1 Homework

## Task Given
As a marketing agency, the task is to improve our own website to ensure accessibility standards are met.

It is expected that the below acceptance criterias have been met once the task is completed:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## How the task was tackled
Since not all of the concepts in the acceptability criterias were addressed in the course at this point, the decision to undertake each acceptance criteria was done at a time through out the entire code.
Taking this approach has allowed the developer to review the entire code several times while researching and understanding different aspects of the code.
